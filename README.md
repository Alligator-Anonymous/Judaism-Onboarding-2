# Derech â€“ Jewish learning companion

Derech is an Electron + React desktop app that offers a gentle, offline-first way to explore Judaism. The MVP includes a Today dashboard with zmanim, a Tanakh + Siddur reader, and a Practice lab for Hebrew and FAQs.

* Friendly, non-judgmental copy for beginners and conversion candidates
* Seed data for Genesis 1, daily siddur essentials, and a 15-question FAQ
* Ethical guardrail: **This app is for learning, not for halachic rulings. Practices vary by community; consult your rabbi.**

## Quick start

npm install
