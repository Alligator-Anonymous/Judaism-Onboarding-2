  "fiveMin": "The word literally means 'commandment' but also connotes connection. Some mitzvot guide ritual practice; others direct ethical living.",
  "deepDive": "The Torah counts 613 mitzvot; later sages categorize them as positive (do) and negative (avoid). Rabbinic mitzvot like lighting Hanukkah candles safeguard core values. Many teachers today invite learners to see mitzvot as opportunities to bring holiness into daily routines.",
