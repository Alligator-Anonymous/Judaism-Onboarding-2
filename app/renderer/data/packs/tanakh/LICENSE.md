# Data Sources

The Tanakh and Targum datasets in this directory are intended to be fetched from the public Sefaria API (https://www.sefaria.org/api) which curates public-domain base texts for the Hebrew Bible and the Targum Onkelos. Sefaria distributes these texts under permissive terms (Creative Commons Zero / public domain where applicable). Please refer to https://www.sefaria.org/developers for licensing details.

When the automated fetch script is executed (`npm run fetch:tanakh`), the resulting JSON files remain in the public domain. Downstream consumers should retain this license notice when redistributing the generated data.
